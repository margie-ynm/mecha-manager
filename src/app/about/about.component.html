<h1>About</h1>
<p>M.E.Ch.A is a nationwide organization. M.E.Ch.A. stands for Movimiento Estudiantil Chicanx de Aztlán.</p>
<p>MOVIMIENTO was chosen in recognition that we are much more than an organization, more than just a network, much more than a coalition: we are MOVEMENT. Our aim is self-determination (deciding for ourselves, controlling our destiny); whose ideas and actions cannot be stopped until that aim is accomplished.</p>
<p>ESTUDIANTIL is appropriate because, as students, we realize that we are only part of a much larger movement of people that includes farmworkers, packing house workers, factory workers, professionals, and others who are fighting for equality in their own struggles. ESTUDIANTIL was also chosen because our main fight is for educational rights.</p>
<p>CHICANX is our identity. It rejects the old notion that we were merely a minority group that was a part of the Anglo American melting pot. It is a symbol of resistance as well as a symbol of unity amongst Latinxs, Mexicanxs, Hispanxs and Tejanxs, and has come to represent the struggles and fight all Latinx people. It is a demand for self-identity, and at the same time, an assertion of the pride we have for our unique history and culture. It is the clearest expression of national consciousness, as well as the loudest demand for self-determination that we could express. Chicanx refers to one’s attitude, political ideals, and way of life; therefore, we welcome all to our organization that champion our similar goals and beliefs.</p>
<p><strong>Being a member of M.E.Ch.A. Is not limited to a classification of color, race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation or ability. It means giving back to our community and neighborhoods. It means giving more opportunity to our children than what we had. It means never forgetting where we came from.</strong></p>
